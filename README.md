# The Unofficial Sublime Text 3 Bug and Issue Tracker

This is an *unofficial* bug tracker for Sublime Text bugs and issues run by the community.
Feel free to write here as you desire. For the inital idea, read this forum thead: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=12095.

We are looking for inspiration and other ideas, your comments are welcome.

## The issue list

Head straight to https://github.com/SublimeText/Issues/issues for a list of all issues or click `Issues` in the navigation bar above.

## Before creating a new issue

*   Make sure it isn't a package that's causing the bug. Start with a [clean profile](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/revert.html) if you need. 

    This repo is only for *Sublime Text-related* bugs and not for package's or plugin's bugs, submit these to the packages' repositories instead.
*   Search for the bug [here](https://github.com/SublimeText/Issues/issues/search?q=) to see if an issue already exists. You may use labels for filterting the issue list [here](https://github.com/SublimeText/Issues/issues) by clicking any of these related to the problem you want to report.

## Filing a bug

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.
*   Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, giving an idea of what the issue is about.
*   Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.
    Be sure to include information about:
    * your OS,
    * the ST version, and
    * any related software which may cause ST to act strangely.
*   Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. It might be useful to include a code example for this.
*   Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

## Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise subject that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
*   Explain briefly what the issue is about and why you think it would be useful.
*   Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behaviour as opposed to something entirely new.
